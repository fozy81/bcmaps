#' scotmaps: A data package providing open licence map layers for Scotland
#'
#' Various layers of Scotland, including administrative boundaries, natural
#' resource management boundaries, etc. All layers are available as
#' [sf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) objects, and sourced from
#' [spatialdata.gov.scot](https://www.spatialdata.gov.scot/) in [British
#' National Grid 27700](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/27700). Each
#' layer's individual help page contains a section describing the source for the
#' data. This package is modified from `bcmaps` package.
